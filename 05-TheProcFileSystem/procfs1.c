 *  procfs1.c -  create a "file" in /proc
 */

/**
 * This structure hold information about the /proc file
 *
 */
struct proc_dir_entry *Our_Proc_File;
/* Put data into the proc fs file.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 * 1. The buffer where the data is to be inserted, if
 *    you decide to use it.
 * 2. A pointer to a pointer to characters. This is
 *    useful if you don't want to use the buffer
 *    allocated by the kernel.
 * 3. The current position in the file
 * 4. The size of the buffer in the first argument.
 * 5. Write a "1" here to indicate EOF.
 * 6. A pointer to data (useful in case one common
 *    read for multiple /proc/... entries)
 *
 * Usage and Return Value
 * ======================
 * A return value of zero means you have no further
 * information at this time (end of file). A negative
 * return value is an error condition.
 *
 * For More Information
 * ====================
 * The way I discovered what to do with this function
 * wasn't by reading documentation, but by reading the
 * code which used it. I just looked to see what uses
 * the get_info field of proc_dir_entry struct (I used a
 * combination of find and grep, if you're interested),
 * and I saw that it is used in <kernel source
 * directory>/fs/proc/array.c.
 *
 * If something is unknown about the kernel, this is
 * usually the way to go. In Linux we have the great
 * advantage of having the kernel source code for
 * free - use it.
